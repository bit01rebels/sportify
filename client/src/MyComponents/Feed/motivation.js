          Motivation is the mental process that initiates, sustains or guides an
          athleteâ€™s behavior (training, approach to competition, managing
          adversity, performance). There are two types of motivation in sports:
          intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation
          refers to athletic behavior that is driven by internal or personally
          meaningful rewards (opportunities to explore, learn, and actualize
          potential). Intrinsically motivated athletes participate in sport for
          reasons such as: the enjoyment of playing their sport, the challenge
          of competition and reaching new personal levels, skill improvement,
          exploration of potential, etc. Intrinsically motivated athletes
          typically concentrate on skill improvement and their growth as
          athletes. Extrinsic motivation refers to athletic behavior that is
          geared toward earning external rewards or to avoid punishment.
          Extrinsically motivated athletes participate in sport for motives such
          as external rewards (trophies, scholarships, media attention,
          accolades) or to avoid negative consequences (being benched, falling
          out of favor with coach, disapproval of parent). Extrinsically
          motivated athletes tend to focus on the outcomes of athletic contests.
